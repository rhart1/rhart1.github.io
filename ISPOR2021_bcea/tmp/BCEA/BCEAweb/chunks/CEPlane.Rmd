## Cost-effectiveness plane
The following graph shows the cost-effectiveness plane. This presents the joint distribution of the population average benefit and cost differential, $(\Delta_e,\Delta_c)$. 


Each point in the graph represents a 'potential future' in terms of expected incremental economic outcomes. The shaded portion of the plane is the '_sustainability area_'. The more points lay in the sustainability area, the more likely that the reference intervention will turn out to be cost-effective, at a given willingness to pay threshold, $k$ (in this case selected at $k=$ `r input$value1`)


```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=4.6, fig.height=4.6,fig.align=align}
n.ints <- m()$n.comparators
if (n.ints==2) {graph="base"; pos=c(1,1)} else {graph="ggplot2"; pos=TRUE}
ceplane.plot(m(),graph=graph,pos=pos)
```
