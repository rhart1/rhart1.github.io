## Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve
The following graph shows the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC represents the proportion of 'potential futures' in which the reference intervention is estimated to be more cost-effective than the comparator. Thus, it can be interpreted as the 'probability of cost-effectiveness'.
